## Description

_Recently studying up further on CSS, I thought I'd give it a whirl to try and make a simple game using only CSS and no JavaScript at all.  This solution makes use of the `:checked` pseudo-class selector to display the player choice in a square and then check to see if a win outcome is satisfied, displaying the winner's message with the `::after` pseudo-element._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone it and open it (no live demo up yet, sorry)_


## Known Bugs

_It looks like garbage._

## Support and contact details

_Where I am needed I shall be found._

## Technologies Used

_CSS only please, hold the JavaScript._
